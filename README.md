# DJI UAV Challenge

This repository presents an experimental study on **PID control tuning** and **flight log analysis** in the context of the DJI UAV Challenge.  
The project demonstrates how UAV flight stability can be quantitatively evaluated and improved using classical control theory.

## Motivation

In UAV applications, maintaining stable altitude and attitude is critical for safe and efficient flight.  
However, manual tuning of PID (Proportionalâ€“Integralâ€“Derivative) parameters is often a trial-and-error process, prone to instability and overshoot.  

This project provides:
- A **simulation-based framework** to test PID controllers.
- A **data-driven approach** to analyze flight logs and visualize UAV responses.
- A reproducible workflow for UAV control experiments.
